# twitter-delete

This deletes all your tweets. Or it tries to, anyway.

It uses python and Selenium to drive a local Firefox browser to do the work. (No twitter API usage.)

Do I really need to tell you to back things up first? (Twitter allows you to download all your posts as an archive.)

**HAVE A BACKUP.**

Put your username and password in a file called "credentials.txt" looking something like this:

	username: tweetyacount
	password: seekrit

Then run the script.

Have fun!
