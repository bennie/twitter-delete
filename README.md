# twitter-delete

This deletes all your tweets. Or it tries to, anyway.

It uses python and Selenium to drive a local browser to do the work. (No twitter API usage.)

Do I really need to tell you to back things up first?

**HAVE A BACKUP.**

Put your username and password in a file called "credentials.txt" looking something like this:

	username: tweetyacount
	password: seekrit

The run the script.

Have fun!
